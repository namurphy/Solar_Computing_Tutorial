## Logistics

We will meet at this [Zoom link](https://harvard.zoom.us/j/97378386470?pwd=bE1YVHJMRDVnYU4zOTRYeCtFNkd2QT09).  Clicking on this [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/main) will create an environment with everything we need pre-installed that we can each access from our web browser.

### Day 1: Unix Shell (Tuesday, June 8 from 3:30-5:30 pm EDT)

This tutorial will cover how to use bash, which is the most popular
Unix shell.  This tutorial will be based off of Software Carpentry's
[Unix Shell Tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

### Day 2: Python (Wednesday, June 9 from 3-5 pm EDT)

### Day 3: Python (Thursday, June 10 from 3-5 pm EDT)
