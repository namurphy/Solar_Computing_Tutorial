## Logistics

We will meet at this [Zoom link](https://harvard.zoom.us/j/97378386470?pwd=bE1YVHJMRDVnYU4zOTRYeCtFNkd2QT09).  Clinking on this [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/master) will create an environment with everything we need pre-installed that we can each access from our web browser.

## Tentative schedule

The schedule has been adapted to allow participation in the [Strike for Black Lives](https://www.particlesforjustice.org/strike-details) on Wednesday, June 10.

### Day 1: Unix Shell (Tuesday, June 9 from 3-5 pm EDT)

This tutorial will cover how to use bash, which is the most popular
Unix shell.  This tutorial will be based off of Software Carpentry's
[Unix Shell Tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

### Day 2: Python (Thursday, June 11 from 3-5 pm EDT)



### Day 3: Python (Friday, June 12 from 3-5 pm EDT)

### Day 4: Python for Heliophysics and Clean Coding (Monday, June 13 from 3-5 pm EDT)

## Resources

### Bash (Unix shell)

These resources are likely to be helpful with getting started with
bash.

 - [Bash guide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide)
 - [Bash video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFMyUgF6I8Y)

The following resources talk about how to write a shell script in
significantly more depth:
