# Instructions for setting up computing environment

## Install the Unix (bash) shell

shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell).

## Download this repository to your computer

Please download the [zip file for this
repository](https://github.com/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
and unzip it in a location 

## Using binder as a backup

If you have difficulty installing the software, an alternativeis to go to this
**[binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/main)**,
which will create a computing environment with everything that you need installed.
The main disadvantage of binder is that it doesn't automatically save your progress,
so you might lose where you're at if your internet connection is intermittent.
This will be more of a problem for Python than for the shell part of the tutorial
