# Instructions for setting up computing environment

## Install the Unix (bash) shell

Please follow Software Carpentry's [instructions for installing the bash
shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell).

## Install Python 3.7+

Please follow Software Carpentry's [instructions for installing Python with 
Anaconda](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python).

## Download this repository to your computer

Please download the [zip file for this
repository](https://github.com/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
and unzip it.  It will create a directory called `Solar_Computing_Tutorial-main`
that contains the files needed for these tutorials.

## Using binder as a backup

If you have difficulty installing the software, an alternative is to go to this
**[binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/Solar_Computing_Tutorial/main)**,
which will create a computing environment with everything that you need installed.
The disadvantage of binder is that it doesn't automatically save your progress, so
you might lose your progress if your internet connection is intermittent. This won't
be a huge problem when we go through the Unix shell, but has the potential to cause 
problems when we cover Python.
